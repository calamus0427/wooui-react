## Intro

This project was mainly bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)、[React App Rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired) and [React Styleguidist](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist)。Developing and building a React UI Component Library will be much more easier.

## Available Scripts Now

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

### `yarn styleguide:build`
